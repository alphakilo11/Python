Attack On Europe: Documenting Russian Equipment Losses During The 2022 Russian Invasion Of Ukraine
Oryx Thursday, February 24, 2022 Bayraktar TB2 , DNR 0 Comments

By Stijn Mitzer and Jakub Janovsky in collaboration with Joost Oliemans, Kemal, Dan, and naalsio26
  
This list only includes destroyed vehicles and equipment of which photo or videographic evidence is available. Therefore, the amount of equipment destroyed is significantly higher than recorded here. Small arms, ATGMs, MANPADS, mortars, loitering munitions, drones used as unmanned bait, civilian vehicles, trailers and derelict equipment are not included in this list. All possible effort has gone into avoiding duplicate entries and discerning the status of equipment between captured or abandoned. Many of the entries listed as 'abandoned' will likely end up captured or destroyed. Similarly, some of the captured equipment might be destroyed if it can't be recovered. When the origin of a piece of equipment can't be established, it is not included in the list. The Soviet flag is used when the equipment in question was produced prior to 1991. This list is constantly updated as additional footage becomes available.

Our list showing destroyed and captured Ukrainian vehicles and equipment can be found here. For a list of Russian equipment losses during the First Chechen War click here. For a list of Russian equipment losses during the the Second Chechen War click here. And for a list of Russian equipment losses during the 2008 Russo-Georgian War click here.
